## Key Features
- **Daily Sentence**
  - Randomly select one note (in a particular way) and display its content (my implementation is one sentence per note with some tags)
> **Note**: you need to mannually store the sentences locally in your vault.
- **Daily Note Button**
  - Open or create Today's Daily Note via a button
  - Automatically roll over unchecked checkboxes from your last Daily Note
> **Note**: your Language need to be **English**. Otherwise the command will fail (you can fix this by changeing the button code).
- **Shortcuts**
  - List the links of all notes whose **alias** contains "notebook"
